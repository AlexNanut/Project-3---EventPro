# Overview


## The Challenge

I took on the challenge of creating a comprehensive event management application that boasts both a user-friendly interface and extensive functionality. The primary goal was to enable users to effortlessly create, edit, and manage their events, while also providing them with the convenience of discovering and attending events organized by others. I'm proud to share that my application is responsive and accessible, catering to a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

My objectives for this challenge were as follows:

1. Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
2. Enable users to create, add, delete, and edit events. 
3. Allow users to browse and filter events created by other users based on specific criteria such as location, date, time, and category.
4. Provide featurse for users to mark attendance at events view the events they are attending.
5. Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.



## Assigned User Story:
```
I want to be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application securely.
I want to create, add, delete, and edit events with necessary details such as location, date, time, and category.
I want to browse events created by other users and filter them based on location, date, time, and category.
I want to mark my attendance to events and view the events I am attending.
I want the application to be responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application securely.
Logged-in users can create events, providing all required details (location, date, time, and category).
Users can add, delete, and edit their events.
The application has a responsive and polished UI.
The application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
```


## Usage Instructions:
1. Sign up or log in to access the JDT Event Manager application securely.
2. Create, add, delete, and edit events by providing necessary details such as location, date, time, and category.
3. Browse and filter events created by other users based on criteria like location, date, time, and category.

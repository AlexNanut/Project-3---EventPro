# Overview


## The Challenge

I took on the challenge of creating a comprehensive event management application that boasts both a user-friendly interface and extensive functionality. The primary goal was to enable users to effortlessly create, edit, and manage their events.

My objectives for this challenge were as follows:

1. Authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out securely.
2. Enable users to create, add, delete, and edit events. 
3. Allow users to browse and filter events.
4. Provide features for users to mark attendance at events.
5. Ensure that the application is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.



## Assigned User Story:
```
I want to be able to sign up, log in, and log out of the application securely.
I want to create, add, delete, and edit events with necessary details such as location, date, time, and category.
I want to browse events created by other users.
I want to mark my attendance to events and view the events I am attending.
I want the application to be responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
Users can sign up, log in, and log out of the application securely.
Logged-in users can create events.
Users can add, delete, and edit their events.
The application has a responsive and polished UI.
The application is accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
```


## Usage Instructions:
1. Sign up or log in to access the EventPro application securely.
2. Create, add, delete, and edit events.
